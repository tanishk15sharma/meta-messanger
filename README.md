# Next.js 13 Meta Messenger

Last week I tried NextJS13 and built a realtime responsive Chat Application Meta-Messenger. Users can login with their facebook a/c and use this chat application to talk with their friends/family.
Learning realtime experiences was the main objective. In this,
- 20+ user in a group can chat while experiencing realtime chat updates.
- Blue colored right side aligned messanger will be visible by the currect user who is logged in, others mesagers will be red colored left aligned.
- Input validations
- Signout user and its validations
- Signin with Facekbook Account
- Full Responsive
